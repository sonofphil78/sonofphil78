- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris.
- 👀 I’m interested in optimization algorithms particularly pertaining to physical infrastructure asset management and capital planning.  My career has been in construction and energy efficiency fields, but recently I have worked on asset management with a COTS optimization software.  I figured learning coding might come in handy someday, and I needed something to learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to asset management or captial project planning.  Way off in the future may look into machine learning to download my industry experience into executable code.
